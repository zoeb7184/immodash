# Responsive Testing Checklist

How to verify responsive design without a visual canvas. Organized from fastest to most thorough.

## The Drag-Resize Habit

The single most valuable responsive testing technique: in Chrome DevTools device mode (`Cmd+Shift+M`), set to Responsive (not a preset device), then slowly drag the right handle from 280px to 2560px.

**Don't jump between breakpoints — drag continuously.** This catches:
- Content overflow at widths between breakpoints
- Text collision and wrapping issues
- Layout collapse at unexpected widths
- Elements that look fine at 768px but break at 900px

---

## Media Query Visualization (Underused DevTools Feature)

In device toolbar: More Options > Show Media Queries. Chrome draws color-coded bars:
- Orange = `min-width` queries (mobile-first)
- Blue = `max-width` queries (desktop-first)
- Green = range queries

Click bars to jump to that breakpoint. Right-click to see the rule in source.

## Priority Viewport Widths

Ranked by 2026 device market share and likelihood of catching issues:

| Priority | Width | Represents |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 390px | iPhone 12-15 (most common iPhone) |
| 2 | 360px | Most common Android |
| 3 | 1920px | Dominant desktop (22% market share) |
| 4 | 768px | iPad / tablet breakpoint |
| 5 | 1366px | Second most common desktop |
| 6 | 375px | iPhone SE / older iPhones |
| 7 | 1024px | Laptop / large tablet |
| 8 | 320px | Smallest phone (~3% traffic, good stress test) |
| 9 | 430px | iPhone Pro Max |
| 10 | 1440px | Large laptop |

## The 10-Point Check (At Each Viewport)

1. **No horizontal scroll** — any at all is a failure
2. **Text overflow** — long words, URLs, usernames breaking containers
3. **Images and media** — not overflowing, `max-width: 100%` applied
4. **Touch targets** — 44px minimum on mobile viewports
5. **Navigation** — reachable and usable at this width
6. **Typography** — readable (16px min body), no clipping
7. **Flex/grid wrapping** — wrapping where expected, not where it shouldn't
8. **Positioned elements** — not overlapping or off-screen
9. **Z-index stacking** — modals, dropdowns, tooltips rendering correctly
10. **Sticky elements** — sticking as intended, not overlapping each other

## Edge Cases That Bite

| Edge case | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **280px** (Galaxy Fold inner screen) | Overflow here usually signals a deeper problem |
| **768x1024 portrait** | Tablets in portrait are often treated as desktop incorrectly |
| **Browser zoom 200%** | WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. Text must reflow; containers must not overflow |
| **RTL text** | If localizable, Arabic/Hebrew reverses all directional assumptions |
| **Long unbreakable strings** | Email addresses, URLs, API keys. Use `overflow-wrap: break-word` |
| **Missing images** | Does layout collapse? Does alt text overflow? |
| **2560px+** | Content stretches; test max-width containers |
| **Landscape phone** | Different safe area insets; often forgotten |
| **iOS "Larger Text"** | System accessibility setting. `px` values ignore it; `rem` respects it |
| **Keyboard open on mobile** | Fixed bottom elements get displaced |

## The Three-Tier Testing Strategy

### Tier 1: During Development (Continuous)
Chrome DevTools drag-resize while building. After every meaningful CSS change:
- Drag from 320px to 1920px
- Check each breakpoint transition
- Check 50px above and below each breakpoint

### Tier 2: After a Feature (Automated)
Screenshot comparison at key viewports using Playwright or dev-browser:

```javascript
const viewports = [
  { width: 375, height: 812, name: 'mobile' },
  { width: 768, height: 1024, name: 'tablet' },
  { width: 1440, height: 900, name: 'desktop' },
];

for (const vp of viewports) {
  test(`layout at ${vp.name}`, async ({ page }) => {
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: vp.width, height: vp.height });
    await page.goto('/');
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(`home-${vp.name}.png`);
  });
}
```

First run creates baselines. Subsequent runs fail with a diff image when layout changes unexpectedly.

### Tier 3: Before Shipping (Real Devices)
Spot check on actual devices:
1. **iPhone (iOS Safari)** — most different from Chrome in viewport handling
2. **Android phone (Chrome)** — 360-412px
3. **iPad portrait** — 768px, often missed

iOS Safari has the most quirks: viewport unit behavior, safe areas, scroll momentum.

## Testing Container Queries

Container queries don't respond to viewport — they respond to parent element width. To test in automation:

```javascript
test('card adapts in narrow container', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/components/card');
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    const container = document.querySelector('.card-wrapper');
    container.style.width = '300px';
  });
  const card = page.locator('.card');
  await expect(card).toHaveCSS('flex-direction', 'column');
});
```

---

## Quick Screenshot Comparison (No Test Suite)

When you don't want to set up full Playwright tests:

1. Open DevTools > Device Mode
2. Set to Responsive, width = 375px
3. More Options > Capture Full Size Screenshot
4. Save as `page-375.png`
5. Repeat at 768px and 1440px
6. Compare visually or with an image diff tool

Low overhead, useful for one-off audits and before/after comparisons.

## What to Document in a Behavior Spec

Before coding responsive layouts, describe expected behavior per component:

```
Component: ProductCard
| Viewport   | Layout              | Image        | Text         |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| < 640px    | stack vertical      | full width   | 3 lines max  |
| 640-1023px | horizontal, img left| 40% width    | 2 lines max  |
| 1024px+    | grid card, 320px    | top, full-w  | 1 line       |
```

This table takes 5 minutes and catches "what should happen at X width?" before writing CSS. It's the code-first equivalent of seeing all breakpoints on a canvas.
